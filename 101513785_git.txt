devops
Software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) teams can automate and integrate their processes with the help of DevOps, a collection of methods, technologies, and a cultural philosophy.
When i did the research about it then i came to know that
 Jenkins is one of the most popular tools used for automating the process of Continuous Integration (CI).
 It allows developers to integrate code changes into a shared repository several times a day. 
 Each commit triggers an automated build, followed by automated tests. If the tests pass, the build is successful; if they fail, the team is alerted immediately, allowing them to fix issues quickly.
 Here is some Common Devops Tools:-
 1. Version Control Systems
 2. CI/CD Tools
 3. Configuration Management
 4. Containerization
 5. Container Orchestration
 6. Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
 7. Monitoring and Logging
 8. Security and Compliance
