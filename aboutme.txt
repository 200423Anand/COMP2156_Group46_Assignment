Hi, Iâ€™m Anand Sharma, studying Computer System Technician at George Brown College.

Why did I choose this course?
Since childhood, I have been curious about technology. I often wondered, Why does this happen? How do phones and computers work? Back then, we had Nokia and Samsung keypad phones, and my interest in technology started from there.
This curiosity led me to pursue the Computer System Technician course. Now that I am studying it, my interest has grown even more.
In the future, I plan to take the Computer System Technology course to deepen my knowledge and learn more about advanced technology.
