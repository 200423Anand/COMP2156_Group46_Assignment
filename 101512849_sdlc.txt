Why Learning DevOps is Important in Software Development?

DevOps is important because it makes software development faster, smoother, and more efficient.
  It helps developers and IT teams work together better, so updates and fixes can be released quickly. 
  Automation reduces manual work, cloud computing makes scaling easier, and monitoring tools help catch issues early. 
  Plus, security is built-in from the start. Learning DevOps gives me the skills to streamline development, improve deployment speed, and prepare for a career in DevOps or Cloud Engineering.
