Welcome to Comp 3104 DevOps Course at George Brown College instructed by Professor Pritesh Patel. DevOps is a combination of sofware development and IT operations to improve software delivery speed and quality.
In this course, we will understand to work with tools like Docker, Jenkins, Kubernetes, and Git. Honestly speaking, I enjoyed a lot learning devops because professor is very nice, he always help us with our doubts.
