#Explain devops#
DevOps is a software development approach where development and IT operations
work together to improve collaboration and automation. It focuses on
Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) using tools like
 Jenkins and GitHub Actions. Iâ€™m also learning about Infrastructure as Code
 (IaC) with tools like Terraform and using containerization technologies like Docker and Kubernetes. Automated testing, configuration management, and real-time monitoring help improve software quality and scalability. Overall, 
DevOps speeds up software delivery while ensuring reliability and performance.
