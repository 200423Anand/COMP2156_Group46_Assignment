In the COMP 3104 - DevOps course, taught by Professor "Pritesh Patel", I will explore DevOps principles and practices, focusing on CI/CD pipelines, Infrastructure as Code (IaC), cloud computing, automation, and monitoring. This course builds upon my knowledge from COMP 3044 - Linux Essentials and prepares me for roles in DevOps, Cloud Engineering, and Site Reliability Engineering (SRE).
