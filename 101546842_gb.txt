George Brown COllege(my campus GBC-Casa Loma)


In this file I wanna describe about my perspective on CASA LOMA campus, where most of my classes take place.
FIrst of all out of all other campuses even though peple say they are better,
I am ready to dicuss with anyone who says St. James is better because 
In my perspective, no other campus is as good as Casa Loma for networking and extra curricular activities 
That includes a range of things to enjoy with your classmates or if its just you alone,
in library enjoying the headset and have of GOD in your hand to go wherever on google earth, fo rinternational students a nostalgic experience to visit our hometowns virtually.

I truly enjoyed this experience the first I visited the virtual booth.
Otherthan this amazing experience what makes CASA LOMA outstanding for me would be the POOL table to hone my skills in the game and enjoy the leisure time in between the classes with Other friends on campus.
THis is the only thing that exceeds other campuses in my opinion that i really care about and enjoy as much :-) 

Likewise, We're a leading, publicly accredited college located in the heart of Canada’s economic hub – Toronto. Vibrant, diverse and growing; the city is our classroom.
 Toronto is core to the George Brown College experience, and we wouldn't have it any other way.
With over full and part-time programs developed in consultation with industry, we’ve got something for everyone.
